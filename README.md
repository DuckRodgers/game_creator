# Game Creator App
A simple WebApp which creates Petrobowl-format Excel Games

## How we started
The life of an intern isn't easy. I was responsible for getting each player's individuals question spreadsheets and creating a game in a random way.
Problem 1: What if I wasn't available to create the game?

## Solution
The WebApp *Quizify* takes the standard Petrobowl UFF Team game spreadsheet. One less intern in the world.

## How does it work?
Simple enough. An HTML which accepts a file as an input (containing all questions from all players), runs a little magic inside, selecting 20 questions from each player and then restructs it. What you have on the way out is a file with the name of the day it was created containing a limited amount of questions (randomly selected) from the database.

## We're very thankful people
So thanks to @higortss who inspired this first part. And also thanks to UFF Petrobowl for existing.
